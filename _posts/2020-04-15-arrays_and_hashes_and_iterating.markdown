This was one of my downfalls when I first started learning about code and understanding how to manipulate them. However, going throught he course has help give some insight to tackle these better. How you say?

Well the labs were there to give live examples and implement what you have learned as you go. That isn't to say there were some struggles at first. Mostly with iteration.  The concept of Arrays and Hashes being just unsorted lists was a bit easier to understand when you could have that visualization of it. I also compared them to cells on an excel spreadsheet and that helped get my mind wrapped around what they were and what we were doing with them.

Arrays are fairly straight forward when you treat them as a spreadsheet (this really only works in 1 dimensional arrays, but you can grasp it a bit better for nested arrays afterwars). If you get all the values of an 1D array you can simply list them out in order in a list or cell by cell. However, when you have nested arrays, they tend to work more like bullet points. You can have multiple bullet points but those bullet points can have nested bullet points. There are methods that can combine these arrays and make 2/3/4..D arrays 1D if you choose too (like #flatten), but understanding the structure of the array helps sort out the mess.

Another aspect of hashes was a bit easier to grasp when you realize how keys and values work and my instructor had a good example by opening doors/boxes with keys and seeing the contents or not seeing the contents of the room or box you just had opened with if the hashes were nested or not. Keys work like indexes in an array(but more definable). Values are the same thing as elements of an array, but Keys can be defined with descriptions, words, or values to call them specifically and classify them within other hashes.

Iteration was another beast altogether. Part of interating was understand the Ruby docs, syntax, and just looking up methods that could do some of the iterating for you. There were basic concepts that were explain and how the methods worked and ultimately when you knew where to look you could sort through the doc and find what you need. However, you would need some structural understanding of how hashes and arrays work before you could use them properly. 

True be told, I am still not 100% efficient with all practices yet, but getting better by the day/application I build.
